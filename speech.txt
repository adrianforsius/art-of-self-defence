Go concurrency

what is this talk about?
My name is Adrian Forsius and I'm going to talk about Go and its concurrency, my goal with this talk is to give you a basic understanding of go routines so you can leverage this knowledege in your everyday life. This talk will be in English because I'm more comfortable that way, however I speak an OK amount of spanish so if you have any questions any of these languages are fine.

Who am I?
I am a Software engineer (here?) at Credijusto, I've been developming professionally since 2011. I started wiriting Go code in the end of 2016 which is essentially when I became a full time Gopher. I'm a Swede and I've been living here in CDMX since November 2016. **make a joke**?

So now when we have covered the practical parts of the presentation lets get to it.
